This repo contains an example React App. It's fork from [cypress-example-todomvc](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-todomvc), but without Cypress tests. They are planned to be added as part "from MQA to AQA" course.

Additionally this example app is configured to run tests in Circle CI and Travis CI.

### 1. Install Cypress

[Follow these instructions to install Cypress.](https://on.cypress.io/guides/installing-and-running#section-installing)

### 2. Fork this repo

If you want to experiment with running this project in Continous Integration, you'll need to [fork](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-todomvc#fork-destination-box) it first.

After forking this project in `Github`, run these commands:

```bash
## clone this repo to a local directory
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/cypress-example-todomvc.git

## cd into the cloned repo
cd cypress-example-todomvc

## install the node_modules
npm install

## start the local webserver
npm start
```

The `npm start` script will spawn a webserver on port `8888` which hosts the TodoMVC app.

You can verify this by opening your browser and navigating to: [`http://localhost:8888`](http://localhost:8888)

You should see the TodoMVC app up and running. We are now ready to run Cypress tests.

## Cypress IntelliSense

If you use modern IDE that supports TypeScript (like VSCode), you can benefit
from Cypress type declarations included with the `cypress` NPM module. Just
add `@ts-check` to the spec file and configure "dummy"
[tsconfig.json](tsconfig.json) file and see IntelliSense over `cy.<something>`
commands.
